# CASA

This is a placeholder for the "casa" gem.

Once the Community App Sharing Architecture [protocol](https://github.com/AppSharing/casa-protocol) and [reference implementation](https://github.com/AppSharing/casa-engine) are complete, this gem will serve as a command-line tool through which one can manage, use and deploy the CASA engine and outlets.
